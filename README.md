# treefmt-nix — treefmt configuration for nix users

This repo is for developers that use both [nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix) and
[treefmt](https://numtide.github.io/treefmt). `Treefmt` is a tool that helps you format all your project with one command, and `nix` is a package manager that allows you to specify build configurations in a functional manner.

Things work differently with `nix` than with other package managers. This is why it's handy to have a tool that helps you specify `treefmt` build options,  dependencies and config in one place.

With `treefmt-nix`, you don't have to install neither the formatters nor treefmt manually. `treefmt-nix` installs and configures the needed formatters for you. It maps formatting programs to `treefmt.toml`  entries -- pre-crafted formatter-configs maintained by the community. 

Basically, these configs are the most valuable part of this repository. They are located in the [`programs`](https://github.com/numtide/treefmt-nix/tree/master/programs) folder of this project.
 
## Usage
### Nix classic

To run `treefmt-nix` with nix-classic, import the repo using [`niv`](https://github.com/nmattia/niv):
```
$ niv add numtide/treefmt-nix
```
Alternatively, you can download the source and run `nix-build` in the project root directory:
```
$ nix-build
```

The command will return the helper functions which will be later used to produce a derivation from the specified `treefmt-nix` configuration.

After you installed treefmt-nix, specify the formatter configuration. For instance, this one is for formatting terraform files:

```nix
# myfile.nix
{ system ? builtins.currentSystem }:
let
  nixpkgsSrc = builtins.fetchTarball "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/refs/heads/nixos-unstable.tar.gz";
  treefmt-nixSrc = builtins.fetchTarball "https://github.com/numtide/treefmt-nix/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz";
  nixpkgs = import nixpkgsSrc { inherit system; };
  treefmt-nix = import treefmt-nixSrc;
in
treefmt-nix.mkWrapper nixpkgs {
  # Used to find the project root
  projectRootFile = ".git/config";
  # Enable the terraform formatter
  programs.terraform.enable = true;
  # Override the default package
  programs.terraform.package = nixpkgs.terraform_1;
  # Override the default settings generated by the above option
  settings.formatter.terraform.excludes = [ "hello.tf" ];
}
```
It's a good practice to place the configuration file in the project root directory.

Next, execute this command:
```
$ nix-build myfile.nix
```

This command returns a derivation that contains a `treefmt` binary at `./result/bin/treefmt` in your current directory. The file is actually a symlink to the artifact in `/nix/store`. 

`treefmt.toml` in this case isn't generated: the binary is wrapped with the config.


### Flakes

Running treefmt-nix with flakes isn't hard. The library is exposed as the `lib` attribute:

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs.treefmt-nix.url = "github:numtide/treefmt-nix";

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, treefmt-nix }: {
    formatter.x86_64-linux = treefmt-nix.lib.mkWrapper
      nixpkgs.legacyPackages.x86_64-linux
      {
        projectRootFile = "flake.nix";
        programs.nixpkgs-fmt.enable = true;
        # Here you can specify the formatters to use
        programs.terraform.enable = true;
        # ...and options
        programs.terraform.package = nixpkgs.terraform_1;
      };
  };
}
```
This file is also the place to define all the treefmt parameters like includes, excludes and formatter options. 

After specifying the flake, run [`nix fmt`](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-fmt.html):
```
$ nix fmt
```
Nix-fmt is a tool to format all nix files in the project, but with the specified flake, it starts treefmt-nix and formats your project. 


### Flake-parts

This flake exposes a [flake-parts](https://flake.parts/) module as well. To use it:

1. Add `inputs.treefmt-nix.flakeModule` to the `imports` list of your `flake-parts` call.

3. Add `treefmt = { .. }` (containing the configuration above) to your `perSystem`.

5. Add `config.treefmt.build.wrapper` to the `nativeBuildInputs` of your `devShell`. This will make the `treefmt` command available in the shell using the specified configuration.

    You can also use `config.treefmt.build.programs` to get access to the individual programs, which could be useful to provide them to your IDE or editor.

    For an example, see [haskell-template](https://github.com/srid/haskell-template)'s `flake.nix`.
    
See [this page](https://haskell.flake.page/treefmt) for details.

## Configuration
While dealing with `treefmt` outside of `nix`, the formatter configuration is specified in a `toml` format. On the contrary, with `nix`, you write in with a nix syntax like this:
```nix
  # Used to find the project root
  projectRootFile = ".git/config";
  # Enable the terraform formatter
  programs.terraform.enable = true;
  # Override the default package
  programs.terraform.package = nixpkgs.terraform_1;
  # Override the default settings generated by the above option
  settings.formatter.terraform.excludes = [ "hello.tf" ];
```

**Options:** 
* `Project root file` is the git file of the project which you plan to format. 
* The option `programs.terraform.enable` enables the needed formatter. You can specify as many formatter as you want. For instance:
```
programs.terraform.enable = true;
programs.gofmt.enable = true;
```
* The option `programs.terraform.package` allows you to use a particular build/version of the specified formatter.
* By setting`settings.formatter.terraform.excludes` you can mark the files which should be excluded from formatting. You can also specify other formatter options or includes this way. 

For detailed description of the options, refer to the `treefmt` [documentation](https://numtide.github.io/treefmt/treefmt-configuration.html). 

## Project structure

This repo contains a top-level `default.nix` that returns the library helper functions. 

* `mkWrapper` is the main function which wraps treefmt with the needed configuration.
* `mkConfigFile`
* `evalModule`
* `all-modules`

## Supported programs
`treefmt-nix` currently supports the following formatters:

<!-- `> ls programs/*.nix | grep -v default.nix | cut -d '.' -f 1 | cut -d / -f 2 | LC_ALL=C sort | sed -e 's/^/* /'` -->
<!-- BEGIN mdsh -->
* alejandra
* beautysh
* black
* buildifier
* cabal-fmt
* clang-format
* deadnix
* dhall
* dprint
* elm-format
* erlfmt
* gofmt
* gofumpt
* google-java-format
* hclfmt
* hlint
* isort
* mdformat
* mdsh
* nixfmt
* nixpkgs-fmt
* ocamlformat
* ormolu
* prettier
* purs-tidy
* ruff
* rufo
* rustfmt
* scalafmt
* shellcheck
* shfmt
* stylish-haskell
* stylua
* taplo
* terraform
* yamlfmt
* zprint
<!-- END mdsh -->

For non-Nix users, you can also find the generated examples in the
[./examples](./examples)
folder.

### Adding new formatters

To add a new formatter, look in the `programs` folder to see how the files there are structured.

We happily accept new PRs as long as they adhere to the [formatter
specifications](https://numtide.github.io/treefmt/formatters-spec.html). In terms of default configurations, we don't try to be edgy. Please pick defaults that are standard in your community -- for instance, python is usually indented with 4 spaces, so don't add a python formatter with 2 spaces as the default.
